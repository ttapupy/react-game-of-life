# react-game-of-life

A personal tone React implementation of Conway's cellular automata, called: Game of Life.

It's just a pet project for practicing frontend development and of course for fun too.
It based on an old project of mine, which was written in VBA for excel.
Towards the end I tried to make it responsive as possible.
Users can choose to save their own drawed initial pattern if afterwards it seems it's worth it. These patterns are saved to localStorage.
